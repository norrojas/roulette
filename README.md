## Roulette Game
Roulette is a casino game named after the French word meaning little wheel which was likely developed from the Italian game Biribi. In the game, a player may choose to place a bet on a single number, various groupings of numbers, the color red or black, whether the number is odd or even, or if the numbers are high (19–36) or low (1–18).

## Bets and Payoffs
These payoffs are close to the real mathematical odds of getting such a spin, but slightly lower to allow the casino to make a profit on average

| Bet | Payoff |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Red/Black  | 1 to 1  |
| Odd/Even | 1 to 1 |
| Single number | 35 to 1 |
| 1st 12 (1-12)/(13-24)/(25-36) | 2 to 1 |
| Low (1-18) / High (19-36) | 1 to 1 |

A payoff of 1 to 1 pays even money: a bet of $10.00 earns the gambler $10.00 if the bet wins. On the other hand, a payoff of 17 to 1 means that a bet of $10.00 earns the gambler $170.00. If the gambler loses, no money is paid out and the bet is kept by the casino
